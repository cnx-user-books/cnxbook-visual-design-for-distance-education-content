      <para id="id8285499">Content Areas via the Visual Text Box Editor</para>
      <para id="id3911340">The Visual Text Box editor appears with a menu that looks similar to that of a Microsoft Word document when adding items, folders and discussion. You can type your text into it and format it. You can copy text and paste from plain text word processors, such as Notepad or Wordpad, and format it. You can insert tables, images, and multimedia.</para>
      <para id="id3956330">Tip: White space is sometimes just as important as the elements that make up a web page. White space is the empty space in between the components on the page - in the margins, between columns, etc. If information is dense on a page, it can be made more readable by adding more white space. To add white space between lines in the Blackboard Visual Text Box Editor, simply hit the &lt;enter&gt; key one or two times at the end of a line.</para>
      <para id="id10996882">Tip: You can make different sections of your text stand out by using varied background colors. You must use a table (with invisible borders) to do this. Just copy the following code, filling in the color code of your choice. An example of what the results will look like is shown directly below the code. See browser safe color chart at <link url="http://www.cookwood.com/cookwood/html4_examples/4files/colorhex/colorcharthex.html">Cookwood.com</link>. You can replace the #DDDDDD with any suitable color code from the chart.</para>
